# Homework #1

To discover your project assignment, decrypt the PROJECT.md file with
your private key.

The coding requirements and grading rubric can be found in [requirements.md](requirements.md).

A starting point for Python 3 applications is included as `sample_project.py`.

When you're ready to turn in your code, update this file
with instructions on how I can install and run your project,
as well as any simplifying assumptions and decisions you
made along the way.
