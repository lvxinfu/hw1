# Coding Requirements

This is an odd assignment.  You might not believe these instructions
at first, so feel free to read them over several times.  Lying down
between readings and drinking tea may also be helpful.

<hr>

Once you have been assigned to a specific project, your goal
is to build it _as fast and as simply as possible_.  

In other words, I do not want beautiful code.  I am looking
for the exact opposite: ugly code that (mostly) works.

### Grading Rubric

You will be graded on the following criteria:

* [2 points] **Complete Phase 1 by the Wednesday, April 4 5:30pm**

* [3 points] **Minimum number of files.**  

  You will likely need to use
  several code files in order to cope with compile-time dependencies
  and/or other requirements of the language.  But you should strive
  for _as few files as possible_.  If you use 12 files when I think you could
  have organized it into, say, 4 files, I will deduct points.  That said,
  I don't expect fewer than three files, because that's probably too crazy
  (but it's up to you).

* [4 points] **Names must be 7 characters or less.**

  Class names, method/function names, and variable names must be 7 characters or less.  Code like it's 1991, folks.  

  (If you are using
  a framework that provides base classes or built-in functions,
  those names can remain as is; it's only your own classes that
  must adhere to the 7-character limit)

* [4 points] **Minimum number of classes/functions/methods.**  

  You will likely need
  to invent many different classes, functions, and/or methods in order to build   your program.
  But you must strive for _as few as possible_.  Invent as few classes
  as possible, and as few functions/methods as possible.
  For example, if you use end up with 40 functions when I think you could
  accomplished the same with 10 functions, will deduct points.  

* [4 points] **Implement only the "happy path".**

  Your code does not
  need to be completely bug-free! It does not need to satisfy
  all of the requirements, nor should it worry about performance!
  Remember, this assignment is about building something quickly and
  simply.

  As long as I can accomplish roughly 80% of the described
  functionality, you will get the full 4 points.  

  Do not worry too much
  about error cases.  For example, your code can assume
  that any necessary files exist, that the user (me) follows instructions
  perfectly, that any necessary networking is online, etc.  
  Don't worry about edge cases or esoteric corner cases or other error   conditions.  If I see that you have pre-optimized your code too much
  I will deduct points.

* [3 points] **Document Your Project in the README.md file**

  First, be sure to tell me how to run your project!  I have
  Ruby and Python, as well as XCode/iOS Simulator.  For other
  languages, just let me know how to install & run your code.

  Second, the project requirements will be fuzzy, just as
  real-world requirements are.  Part of this assignment is to
  help you determine how to move forward in the face of ambiguity.
  In your README.md file, you must document the set of simplifying
  assumptions and decisions that you had to make in order to
  complete the assignment.
